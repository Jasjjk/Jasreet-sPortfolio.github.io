            <p>In this city, people wake up at the golden hour. It is a city that goes on getting beautiful and
                green as the perception of people changes. The better the perception the more pretty it appears.
                There are no alarm clocks. The city relies on the cocks voice and body's natural clock to wake
                up. It is a city of dreams in which people from their boring and caged life want to escape to
                and pursue their passion. People are very keen to come here and pursue their passion and simple
                life where there is freedom. You won't be able to get to know a lot about the city just by looking
                at the outward beautiful landscape. The city is made up of beautiful crops growing abundantly
                because of the farmer's hard work, the laughter of children playing and lost in their imagination,
                gossip, and the laughing exercise of old people and people who are living in the present. The city 
                keeps on prospering because of these things The city is different from the bustling life where people are a slave to work and think that they are happy but inside they are just tired of the rat race. Here we will be able to feel the clear and pollution-free air. It's more like a village. People are more caring and helpful. One would be able to feel the balmy air, green hills, and rich woods of a village. It is a place where you see everyone in a very raw manner. They are appreciated for being who they are and there are no tags attached to them. It was unlike the city where people were appreciated for being themselves but for the qualities that possessed that was quite important for being appreciated in the society. In the city, there are seven gates. You have to be careful which gate to enter the city from. Some gates are huge, and there are beautifully carved out designs on them and some are very narrow and dull looking.
                You will get into a maze if you enter the huge and beautiful gate but if you enter the narrow gate
                you will be able to enjoy the scenery and the nature around you. Here life is different from the 
                huge cities where people are stuck in a never-ending cycle of routine. Here there is freedom and 
                people enjoy and live in the present. Here no one has a set routine in their mind and everyone just
                 goes with the flow. People are deeply in touch with nature.
