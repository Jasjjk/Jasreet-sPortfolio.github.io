            <p>In this city people wake up at the golden hour. It is a city which goes on getting beautiful
            and green as the perception of people changes. The better the perception the more pretty it
             appears.  There are no alarm clocks. The city relies on the cocks voice and body's natural clock
             to wake up. It is a city of dream in which people from their boring and caged life want to escape
             to and pursue their passion. People are very keen to come here and pursue their passion and the 
             simple life where there is freedom. You won't be able to get to know a lot about the city just by
             looking at the outward beautiful landscape. The city is made up of the beautiful crops growing 
             abundantly because of the farmers hard work, laughter of children playing and lost in their imagination,
             gossips and the laughing exercise of old people  and people who are living in the present. The city 
             keeps on prospering because of these things <br><a href="more.html"><button class="btn btn-sm">Read More</button></a>

            <p>The city is different from the bustling life where people are a slave to work and think that they 
                are happy but inside they are just tired of the rat race. Here we will be able to feel the clear 
                and pollution free air. Its more like a village. People are more caring and helpful. One would be 
                able to feel the balmy air, green hills and rich woods of a village. It is a place where you see 
                everyone in a very raw manner. They are appreciated for being who they are and there are no tags 
                attached to them. It was unlike the city where people were appreciated for for being themselves
                 but for the qualities that possessed that was quite important for being appreciated in the society.
                  In the city, there are seven gates. You have to be careful which gate to enter the city from.
                   Some gates are hume, and there are beautiful carved out designs on it and some are very narrow
                    and dull looking. <br> <a href="no.html"> <button class="btn btn-sm">Read More</button></a>

            <p>You will get into a maze if you enter the huge and beautiful gate but if you enter the narrow gate
                 you will be able to enjoy the scenery and the nature around you. Here life is different from the 
                 huge cities where people are stuck in a never ending cycle of routine. Here there is freedom and
                 people enjoy and live in the present. Here noone has a set routine in their mind and everyone just
                 go with the flow. People are deeply in touch with nature. They spend a lot of time outdoors and
                 enjoy the many gifts of nature and feel grateful everyday. In this city people are happy with what
                 they are doing. When you enter the city from the narrow gate the city is actually beautiful and 
                 not just an illusion of being beautiful. People are not deceived when they come to this city as the
                 reality matches their expectations. Even the wild animals are friendly with the humankind and vice
                 versa. It is a city where people believes in God and also work hard. They are grateful each and 
                 everyday for their beautiful life.  <a href="hli.html"><br><button class="btn btn-sm">Read More</button></a>
